"""
This class generates the additional input files needed for CoREAS.
The .reas file specifies core position (and other info).
The .list file contains the antenna positions and names of the detector.
In this generator, starshape and detector antennas (e.g. GP13) are combined.
The core position and the center of the starshape array are fixed on 0, while
the detector antennas are moved at random for each run.

        For CoREAS it's important that all input files (inp, reas and list) are stored in the same directory.
        CoREAS uses the same directory for input and output (keyword DIRECT in .inp file) and this cannot be 
        changed.

        After the run is complete it is possible to move the files anywhere of course. 
        In SimulationMaker.py I tried to clean things up a bit by moving the DAT files to "data", but for now
        I keep all CoREAS input (inp, reas, list) and output (new .reas file, traces in "SIMxxxxxx_coreas" folder 
        and "SIMxxxxxx_coreas.bins") in "inp".

        Make sure that the value for OBSLEV specified in the .inp file is the same as CoreCoordinateVertical 
        in the .reas file and (approximately) the same for the z component of the antennas in the .list file. 
        Otherwise, CORSIKA will just crash without any explanation.
